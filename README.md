Runs an ML system locally at no cost with an application that simulates data and prediction on data requested from a database pool. 
Monitors health of system. 
Resources and tools: Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MinIO, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, Pytorch etc

This production grade system is a prototype for personal projects regarding stock prediction with numerical and text data for LLM processing/prediction.
Another system prototype to come later will be for processing, analyzing, and predicting on biological data.
